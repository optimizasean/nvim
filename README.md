# README

I organized the config file to use as much minimalism as possible.

Most of my bindings are sensible or the recommended from the plugins.
I had to change some since people (mostly me) use tmux.

Config is broken into certain groups with nice decorators for ease of reading.
I configure the default vim stuff first, and then plugin installation
and "vim style" configuration.
Finally completing with lua configurations of the plugins.

This is meant to be as neovim as possible.
This is why there is a single file unlike the old vim git method of plugins
with pathogen and plenty directories.
